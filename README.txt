This is still under heavy development, and nowhere near done.

I noticed that there was a vulnerability in Zimbra Email Servers, where it wouldn't give you a captcha on failed logins.

So, I decided to make my own dictionary attacker to exploit it.

Currently, because of the fact that I just started it today, it doesn't even have dictioanry support.

At the moment it's formatted as a BlueJ project, but will be changed to a normal Java program soon.

This requires Isonyx's HTTPRequest HTTP Wrappers to run, they can be found here:

Enjoy!
